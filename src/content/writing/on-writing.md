Code is communication. We write for two audiences: the machine (which executes) and humans (who read, review, and maintain). The latter is arguably more important—code is read far more often than it's written.

But there's another form of communication we neglect: prose.

## Writing Clarifies Thinking

You don't truly understand something until you can explain it simply. This is the Feynman technique, and writing is its purest form. When you write:

- Gaps in understanding become obvious
- Assumptions surface
- Structure emerges from chaos

This applies to system design docs, RFCs, incident postmortems, and even code comments. The act of writing forces clarity.

## The Transferable Skills

Good writing and good code share DNA:

| Writing | Code |
|---------|------|
| Clear thesis | Single responsibility |
| Logical flow | Control structures |
| Precise vocabulary | Good naming |
| Concise sentences | DRY principle |
| Revision | Refactoring |

The skills compound. Engineers who write well design better APIs, write clearer documentation, and communicate more effectively with cross-functional teams.

## Practical Habits

1. **Write before coding** — Sketch the approach in prose. Often, the design flaws appear before you've written a line of code.

2. **Keep a dev journal** — Daily notes on what you tried, what failed, what worked. Invaluable for debugging future similar issues.

3. **Review your own writing** — Read it aloud. If it sounds awkward, revise.

4. **Read good writers** — Paul Graham, Joel Spolsky, John Ousterhout. Notice how they structure arguments.

This space is my forcing function. By committing to publish, I commit to understanding. The posts won't be perfect, but they'll be honest attempts at clarity.

If you're an engineer who doesn't write regularly, try it. Start with a technical explanation for your past self. The benefits compound faster than you expect.
